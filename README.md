Algorithms and Data Structures Practice Repository
Welcome to my Algorithms and Data Structures practice repository!

About
This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress in learning and practicing algorithms and data structures. It serves as a personal space for me to store code implementations, notes, and resources as I explore this fascinating field.

Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to:

Document my learning journey.
Practice implementing various algorithms and data structures.
Experiment with different programming languages and paradigms.
Serve as a reference for future projects and learning endeavors.
Content
Currently, the repository contains:

Implementations of basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
Algorithm implementations covering topics like sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms.
Notes and explanations accompanying each implementation to reinforce understanding.
Links to external resources, tutorials, and online courses that I find helpful in my learning process.
How to Use
Feel free to explore the repository! Here are some suggestions on how to navigate and utilize its contents:

Browse the Code: Take a look at the implemented algorithms and data structures. Try to understand how they work and how they're implemented in different programming languages.
Experiment: Fork the repository and experiment with the code. Make modifications, optimize algorithms, or implement new ones.
Learn: Read through the accompanying notes and explanations to deepen your understanding of each topic.
Contribute: If you spot any errors, optimizations, or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or pull request. Contributions are welcome!
Future Plans
As I continue my journey in learning algorithms and data structures, I plan to:

Expand the repository with more advanced algorithms and data structures.
Include solutions to common coding interview questions.
Explore additional programming languages and paradigms.
Incorporate more visualizations and interactive examples to aid understanding.
